    firstParagraph:
      "Graduated in Architecture and Urban Planning from Uniplac in Brasilia in 2010 and a Masters degree in Architecture from the University of Portsmouth in the UK in 2016. However, the affinity for architecture began decades earlier, since childhood, with parents working in the area. In 2013, she devoted a year to learning how to photograph professionally, which contributed to her visual skills, perception and sensitivity. After graduating in Brazil and working in diverse projects, she decided to continue her personal and professional improvement abroad. She has worked in renowned offices in New York, England and Germany. In Brazil, she acted as project manager for bids and public works, as well as several autonomous projects. Currently, she invests her time in the administration of refurbishments aimed at real estate and residential projects, always seeking to diversify the portfolio and make a difference in the projects she works on. The purpose of this job is always to do the best you can with whatever budget, and prove that architecture, design and good taste do not rely solely on financial resources. Every idea, however good it may be, can and should be improved!",
